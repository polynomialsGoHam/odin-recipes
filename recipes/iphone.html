    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Now now, this may look like it loses you hundreds, if not <strong>thousands</strong> of dollars, your time, and <em>any</em> meaning in life you had up until this point, but I'm just here to say... </p>
    <p>You're absolutely right! And it probably isn't even edible either! but hey, maybe it <strong><em>is</em></strong> and we just don't know it yet! Let's put it to the test!!!!</p>
    <p>Ingredients:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Iphone (Model 5 or above, below that and it takes to long to cook).</li>
        <li>A pot, big enough to hold whatever Iphone you have, and some water.</li>
        <li>And some water.</li>
        <li>Make sure you have water.</li>
        <li>Dont forget to pay your hydro bill.</li>
        <li>Confirm you have water before continuing.</li>
        <li>I know for a fact you didn't confirm your tap was expelling water effectively, you must check before you continue to anything else.</li>
        <li>Since I know for a fact you didn't check if you had water, I just gave you fake ingredients. The real ingredients can be accessed <a href="./ingredients.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>, only once you are 100% sure you have water.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Make sure you have water.</li>
        <li value="69">Grab an Iphone.</li>
        <li value="2">Just kidding, if you read the actual instructions you already know that.</li>
        <li>Take out a pot of exactly 01010011(83) litres.</li>
        <li>Put the nearest newborn fork in the microwave until your house burns down</li>
        <li>You now have a delicous fork to eat!</li>
        <li>Before you continue with the steps above, make sure you have a pot and fork.</li>
        <li>Did you remember to pay your untentils bill? How about the pot bill? Go check right now.</li>
